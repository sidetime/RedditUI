# RedditUI
Reverts Reddit to 2nd Generation UI (new.reddit.com)

Since new.reddit.com didn't work for me anymore, I created a small scripts which edits the websites css.
Most noticible the round edges around Posts, background and post color and the left searchbar.

Add the script in Tampermonkey and you're ready to go.
